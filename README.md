# CUDA at Scale Project

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the use of CUDA for parallel computing, implementing a simple kernel to add two arrays in parallel on the GPU. The code showcases the basic concepts of kernel execution, memory management, and data transfer between the host and device.

## Requirements
- CUDA Toolkit (version X.X or later)
- GCC or MSVC for compiling C++ code
- An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support

## How to Compile and Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cuda-at-scale-project.git
   cd cuda-at-scale-project
